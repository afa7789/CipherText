# Cipher Text

While I was browsing the internet I stumbled upon a art exibition from Paglen on PysOps and one of it's pieces had a "secret message". It mentioned that it was for viewers, so they could decode//crack it.
Since I was studying cryptoanalysis I figured out I could use frequency analysis attack to try and creack it. But in the end it was a HEXED encoding only.
Lesson learned check what is your resource before hand.
